1) refactor blocks class to use getters
    a) supports images from multiple directions with getimg( angle)
    b) supports different ceiling and floor images

    c) consider either generating on the fly an average floor /ceiling colour or pre loading it

2) fix floor lighting

3) fix line in the middle and outside of floors due to texture coords being non integer fix by flooring or by adding +1

4) make floor texture recursive subdivision, to reduce the distortion up close. N divisions based on distance.

5) set max depth for transparent textures, consider a non transparent variant after second or (N) layer?

6) fix skybox line in the north east direction

7) fix floors rendering behind abyss blocks, k

10) consolidate config

11) fix GitHub preview not working, or replace with something else to send a link to people

20) better image loading, not lazy method,
21) game shouldn't crash if an img load fails!


30) custom ray collision math => allows for complex wall shapes


100) replace solid colour floor draw with an average over a given distance to anti alias long distance draws
    potentialy draw for a max of x pixels before switching to next draw colour?

110) use affine textures for walls
    potentialy only for long distance? obscured by a another object etc

200) redo entire algo sort everything by distance and draw one after the other so sprites dont draw over ceilings

300) add portals!

1'000'000) make it 3d!
